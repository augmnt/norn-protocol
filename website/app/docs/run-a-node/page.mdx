# Run a Node

Run your own Norn node, hold your thread state locally, and earn validator rewards from every transaction on the network.

## Why Run a Node?

Running a Norn node makes you a direct participant in the protocol. Here is what you get:

- **Earn validator rewards** -- Every transaction pays a commitment fee. Those fees are distributed to validators at each epoch boundary, proportional to stake. No inflation, no token printing -- rewards come purely from real network usage.
- **Hold your own state** -- Your Thread (personal state chain) lives on your machine. You do not depend on anyone else to verify your balances or history.
- **Secure the network** -- More validators means stronger consensus. Your node validates transactions, propagates blocks, and watches for misbehavior.

## Quick Setup

Get a node running with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/augmnt/norn-protocol/main/scripts/setup-node.sh | bash
```

This script will:

1. Install Rust via `rustup` (if not already installed)
2. Build `norn` from source
3. Create a wallet for you
4. Start the node and connect to the devnet

Once it completes, your node is live and syncing blocks.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer full control over each step, follow the manual process below.

### 1. Install Norn

From Git (latest release):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/augmnt/norn-protocol norn-node
```

Or clone and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/augmnt/norn-protocol
cd norn-protocol
cargo install --path norn-node
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
norn --version
```

### 2. Create a Validator Wallet

```bash
norn wallet create --name validator
```

This creates an encrypted keystore in `~/.norn/wallets/`. You will be prompted to set a password. Keep your password safe -- it protects your private key.

### 3. Start the Node

```bash
norn run --dev
```

Your node will:

- Connect to `seed.norn.network` as a peer (automatic)
- Sync all existing blocks from the network
- Store thread and chain state locally (SQLite, persistent)
- Begin validating transactions and participating in consensus

### 4. Get Funded (Devnet Only)

```bash
norn wallet faucet
```

The devnet faucet sends you NORN so you can start transacting and staking immediately. There is a 60-second cooldown between requests.

### 5. Check Your Rewards

```bash
norn wallet rewards
```

This shows your current epoch earnings, blocks until the next distribution, and your projected reward based on stake weight.

## Validator Rewards

Norn has **zero inflation**. There are no block rewards minted out of thin air. Instead, validators earn from real network activity:

1. **Every transaction pays a commitment fee.** Transfers, name registrations, token operations, loom deployments -- all of them contribute fees.
2. **Fees accumulate in an epoch pool.** Each epoch spans 1,000 blocks (roughly 50 minutes at 3-second block times).
3. **At each epoch boundary, the pool is distributed.** Validators receive a share proportional to their stake weight.
4. **More network usage = higher rewards.** As adoption grows, so does the fee pool.

### Checking Rewards

```bash
# View pending fees and projected distribution
norn wallet rewards

# JSON output for scripting
norn wallet rewards --json

# View the current validator set and stake weights
norn wallet validators
```

## Running as a Service

For production deployments, run `norn` as a systemd service so it starts automatically and restarts on failure.

Create the service file at `/etc/systemd/system/norn-node.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Norn Protocol Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=norn
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/norn run --dev --storage sqlite --data-dir /var/lib/norn/data
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then enable and start it:

```bash
# Create a dedicated user
sudo useradd --system --home /var/lib/norn --shell /usr/sbin/nologin norn
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/norn/data
sudo chown norn:norn /var/lib/norn/data

# Enable the service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable norn-node
sudo systemctl start norn-node

# Check status
sudo systemctl status norn-node

# Follow logs
sudo journalctl -u norn-node -f
```

## Network Modes

| Mode | Chain ID | Faucet | Use Case |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| `dev` | `norn-dev` | Enabled (60s cooldown) | Local development, solo validator |
| `testnet` | `norn-testnet-1` | Enabled (1hr cooldown) | Public testing, multi-node |
| `mainnet` | `norn-mainnet` | Disabled | Production deployment |

### Common Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dev` | Dev mode: faucet, solo validator, SQLite storage, auto-bootstrap to devnet seed |
| `--no-bootstrap` | Run as the seed node (no outbound peers) |
| `--storage <TYPE>` | Override storage: `sqlite` (default for --dev), `memory`, `rocksdb` |
| `--boot-node <MULTIADDR>` | Add a custom bootstrap peer |
| `--rpc-addr <ADDR:PORT>` | Bind RPC server (default `127.0.0.1:9741`) |
| `--data-dir <PATH>` | Data directory (default `~/.norn/data`) |
| `--reset-state` | Wipe data directory before starting |

## Monitoring

### Node Status

```bash
norn wallet node-info
```

This returns your node's sync state, connected peers, current block height, and chain ID.

### Prometheus Metrics

Norn exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint on your RPC port:

```
http://localhost:9741/metrics
```

You can scrape this endpoint with Prometheus and visualize with Grafana. Key metrics include:

- `norn_block_height` -- Current block height
- `norn_peer_count` -- Number of connected peers
- `norn_tx_pool_size` -- Pending transaction pool size
- `norn_epoch_fees` -- Accumulated fees in the current epoch

### Health Check

For load balancers and uptime monitors, use the RPC health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9741/health
```
