# Block Explorer

The **Norn Explorer** is a block explorer web app for browsing the Norn network -- blocks, transactions, accounts, tokens, and smart contracts. Built with Next.js 15, React 19, and the `@norn-protocol/sdk`.

**Live instance:** [explorer.norn.network](https://explorer.norn.network)

## Key Pages

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/` | Dashboard with network stats, recent blocks, and transactions |
| `/blocks` | Paginated block list |
| `/block/[height]` | Block detail with metadata and activity counts |
| `/transactions` | Live transaction feed with pending transactions |
| `/address/[address]` | Account balances, transaction history, registered names |
| `/tokens` | Token registry with supply information |
| `/contracts` | Deployed smart contracts |

Real-time updates are powered by WebSocket subscriptions -- blocks and transactions stream in as they are produced.
