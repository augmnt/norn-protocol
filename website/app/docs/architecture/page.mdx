# Architecture

Norn reimagines the relationship between users and the chain. Rather than forcing every transaction through global consensus, Norn treats the chain as a **courtroom**, not a bank.

Users transact directly with each other using cryptographic signatures, maintaining their own personal state histories called *Threads*. The chain intervenes only when there is a dispute, processing fraud proofs rather than transactions.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Threads** | Personal state chains -- each user maintains their own signed history of state transitions, stored locally on their device. |
| **Knots** | Atomic state transitions -- bilateral or multilateral agreements that tie Threads together, signed by all participants. |
| **Weave** | The anchor chain -- a minimal HotStuff BFT blockchain that processes commitments, registrations, and fraud proofs. |
| **Looms** | Off-chain smart contracts -- WebAssembly programs that execute off-chain with on-chain fraud proof guarantees. |
| **Spindles** | Watchtower services -- monitor the Weave on behalf of offline users and submit fraud proofs when misbehavior is detected. |
| **Relays** | P2P message buffers -- asynchronous message delivery between Threads via the libp2p protocol stack. |

## The Courtroom Model

Traditional blockchains act as banks: every transaction must be processed, validated, and stored by every node. This creates inherent scalability limits -- throughput is bounded by block size and consensus overhead.

Norn inverts this model. The vast majority of economic activity happens **off-chain** between two parties, using nothing but cryptographic signatures. The anchor chain (the Weave) serves as a minimal, efficient arbiter of last resort:

- **Normal operation**: Alice and Bob exchange signed messages directly. The chain never sees their transactions.
- **Periodic commitments**: Users publish cryptographic commitments (state hash + version) to the Weave, anchoring their off-chain state.
- **Dispute resolution**: If someone cheats (e.g., signs conflicting states), the counterparty or a Spindle submits a fraud proof. The Weave adjudicates and penalizes the cheater.

## Threads

A Thread is a user's personal state chain -- an ordered sequence of signed state transitions stored on their own device. Each Thread entry contains:

- A state hash (BLAKE3)
- A version number (monotonically increasing)
- The owner's Ed25519 signature

Threads are never uploaded to the chain in full. Only commitments (hash + version) are periodically published to the Weave.

## Knots

A Knot is an atomic agreement between two or more parties. When Alice sends Bob 10 NORN:

1. Alice creates a Knot proposing the transfer
2. Bob validates and co-signs the Knot
3. Both parties append the Knot to their respective Threads

The transfer is final the moment both signatures exist. No block confirmation needed.

## The Weave

The Weave is Norn's anchor chain -- a minimal blockchain running HotStuff BFT consensus. It processes:

- **Commitments** -- Cryptographic state anchors from users
- **Registrations** -- NornNames, NT-1 tokens, Loom deployments
- **Fraud proofs** -- Evidence of cheating, triggering economic penalties

The Weave is intentionally minimal. It does not process transfers or smart contract executions.

## Looms

Looms are off-chain smart contracts powered by WebAssembly. They execute on participants' devices (not on-chain) but are backed by on-chain fraud proof guarantees:

- Contracts are registered on the Weave (with bytecode stored off-chain)
- Execution happens locally with gas metering
- Disputes trigger on-chain fraud proof verification
- Cross-contract calls supported (max depth: 8)

## Spindles

Spindles are watchtower services that monitor the Weave on behalf of offline users. They:

- Watch for conflicting commitments
- Construct and submit fraud proofs
- Operate with rate limiting to prevent spam

## Relays

Relays provide asynchronous P2P message delivery between Threads using the libp2p protocol stack. They enable:

- Message buffering for offline recipients
- Peer discovery and gossip
- State synchronization between nodes
