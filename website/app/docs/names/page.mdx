# NornNames

NornNames is Norn's native **consensus-level** name system, mapping human-readable names to owner addresses. Names are included in WeaveBlocks and propagate to all nodes via P2P gossip, making them globally visible across the network.

## Naming Rules

| Rule | Constraint |
|------|-----------|
| Length | 3--32 characters |
| Character set | Lowercase ASCII letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`), hyphens (`-`) |
| Hyphens | Must not start or end with a hyphen |
| Uniqueness | Globally unique, first-come first-served |

**Valid names:** `alice`, `bob-42`, `my-validator`, `norn-relay-1`

**Invalid names:** `ab` (too short), `-alice` (leading hyphen), `bob-` (trailing hyphen), `Alice` (uppercase), `my name` (spaces)

## Registration Cost

Registering a NornName costs **1 NORN**, which is **permanently burned** (debited from the registrant, not credited to anyone), reducing the circulating supply.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Register a NornName for the active wallet
norn wallet register-name --name alice

# Resolve a NornName to its owner address
norn wallet resolve --name alice

# List names owned by the active wallet
norn wallet names
```

## Using Names in Transfers

Names work seamlessly as transfer recipients. Pass a NornName instead of a hex address:

```bash
norn wallet send --to alice --amount 10
```

The wallet resolves `alice` to the owner's address via `norn_resolveName` before constructing the transfer.

## RPC Methods

| Method | Parameters | Returns |

| `norn_registerName` | `hex` (hex-encoded borsh `NameRegistration`) | `SubmitResult` |
| `norn_resolveName` | `name` (string) | `Option<NameResolution>` |
| `norn_getNamesByOwner` | `address` (hex) | `Vec<NameInfo>` |
