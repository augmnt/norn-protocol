# Wallet Extension

The **Norn Wallet** is a Chrome browser extension for managing NORN on the Norn Protocol. Send and receive tokens, browse activity, register NornNames, and manage multiple accounts -- all from the browser toolbar.

## Features

- Create new wallets or import from private key hex / CLI export
- Send NORN to addresses or NornNames (e.g. `alice`)
- Receive with QR code
- Browse NT-1 tokens and transaction history
- NornNames (NNS) -- register names, transfer to other addresses, and manage name records
- Multi-account support with auto-lock
- Configurable RPC endpoint (defaults to `seed.norn.network`)

## Installation

### Build from Source

```bash
cd wallet-extension
npm install
npm run build
```

### Load in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `wallet-extension/dist` directory

The Norn Wallet icon will appear in your browser toolbar.

## Importing a CLI Wallet

If you already have a wallet created with the Norn CLI, you can import it into the extension:

```bash
# In terminal -- export your CLI wallet's private key
norn wallet export <wallet-name> --show-private-key
```

Then paste the 64-character hex private key into the extension's **Import from CLI** page.

## Configuring RPC Endpoint

By default the extension connects to `seed.norn.network`. To point at a local node:

1. Open the wallet extension
2. Go to Settings
3. Update the RPC URL to `http://localhost:9741`
